wonder      strategy   games  appear weak  frightened  reassure  other tributes   is no competition    then come  fighting  worked very well   girl johanna mason  district 7  few years back  seemed like such  sniveling cowardly fool  no  bothered   until  were only  handful  contestants left  turned   could kill viciously pretty clever  way  played    seems  odd strategy  peeta mellark because hes  bakers son  those years  having enough  eat  hauling bread trays around  made him broadshouldered  strong   take  awful lot  weeping  convince anyone  overlook him    stand   few minutes   doorway   train while  cameras gobble  our images then were allowed inside   doors close mercifully behind us  train begins  move  once  speed initially takes  breath away  course ive never been

here  is why our miners   dig  deep somehow   comes back  coal  school besides basic reading  math most  our instruction is coalrelated except   weekly lecture   history  panem its mostly  lot  blather    owe  capitol  know  must  more than theyre telling us  actual account   happened during  rebellion   dont spend much time thinking   whatever  truth is  dont see how   help   food   table  tribute train is fancier than even  room   justice building  are each given our own chambers    bedroom  dressing area   private bathroom  hot  cold running water  dont  hot water  home unless  boil

never had  shower before its like being   summer rain only warmer  dress   dark green shirt  pants   last minute  remember madges little gold pin   first time    good look   its   someone fashioned  small golden bird  then attached  ring around   bird is connected   ring only  its wing tips  suddenly recognize   mockingj ay theyre funny birds  something   slap   face   capitol during  rebellion  capitol bred  series  genetically altered animals  weapons  common term  them was muttations  sometimesmuttsfor short  was  special bird called  jabberjay  had  ability  memorize  repeat whole human conversations  were homing birds exclusively male  were released into regions where  capitols enemies were known   hiding after  birds gathered words theyd fly back  centers   recorded  took people awhile  realize  was going    districts how private conversations were being transmitted then  course  rebels fed  capitol endless lies   joke was     centers were shut down   birds were abandoned  die off   wild only  didnt die off instead  jabberjays mated  female mockingbirds creating  whole new species  could replicate both bird whistles  human melodies  had lost  ability  enunciate words  could still mimic  range  human vocal sounds   childs highpitched warble   mans deep tones   could re create songs  just  few notes  whole songs  multiple verses   had  patience  sing them    liked your voice  father was particularly fond  mockingjays when  went hunting   whistle  sing complicated songs  them  after  polite pause theyd always sing back  everyone is treated  such respect  whenever  father sang   birds   area  fall silent  listen  voice was  beautiful high  clear   filled  life  made  want  laugh  cry   same time  could never bring myself  continue  practice after  was gone still theres something comforting   little bird its like having  piece   father   protecting   fasten  pin onto  shirt    dark green fabric   background  can almost imagine  mockingjay flying through  trees effie trinket comes  collect   supper  follow  through  narrow rocking corridor into  dining room  polished paneled walls theres  table where   dishes are highly breakable peeta mellark

seems childish apparently effie trinkets duties did  conclude   station   haymitch   overseeing us right into  arena   way thats  plus because  least  can  counted   corral us around  places  time whereas  havent seen haymitch since  agreed  help us   train probably passed  somewhere effie trinket   other hand seems   flying high were  first team shes ever chaperoned  made  splash   opening

least  hour    cry myself  then  just lay curled    bed stroking  silken sheets watching  sun set over  artificial candy capitol  first  expect guards  come     time passes  seems less likely  calm down  still need  girl tribute  district 12 dont    gamemakers want  punish   can   publicly wait until im   arena  sic starving wild animals    can bet theyll make sure  dont   bow  arrow  defend myself before  though theyll give   score  low no    right mind  sponsor  thats   happen tonight since  training isnt open  viewers  gamemakers announce  score  each player  gives  audience  starting place   betting   continue throughout  games  number  is between   twelve  being irredeemably bad  twelve being unattainably high signifies  promise   tribute  mark is   guarantee   person  win its only  indication   potential  tribute showed  training often because   variables   actual arena highscoring tributes  down almost immediately   few years ago  boy  won  games only received  three still  scores can help  hurt  individual tribute  terms  sponsorship  had been hoping  shooting skills might    six   seven even  im  particularly powerful now im sure 111   lowest score   twentyfour  no  sponsors   odds  staying alive decrease  almost zero when effie taps   door  call   dinner  decide  may  well   scores   televised tonight its  like  can hide  happened forever     bathroom  wash  face  its still red  splotchy everyones waiting   table even cinna  portia  wish  stylists hadnt shown  because  some reason  dont like  idea  disappointing them its   ive thrown away   good work  did   opening ceremonies without  thought  avoid looking  anyone   take tiny spoonfuls  fish soup  saltiness reminds    tears  adults begin some chitchat   weather forecast   let  eyes meet peetas  raises  eyebrows  question  happened  just give  head  small shake then  theyre serving  main course  hear haymitch  okay enough small talk just how bad were  today peeta jumps   dont know   mattered   time  showed  no  even bothered  look    were singing some kind  drinking song  think   threw around some heavy objects until  told   could   makes  feel  bit better its  like peeta attacked  gamemakers   least  was provoked too   sweetheart says haymitch somehow haymitch calling  sweetheart ticks  off enough  im  least able  speak  shot  arrow   gamemakers everyone stops eating    horror  effies voice confirms  worse suspicions  shot  arrow  them  exactly  them   direction its like peeta said  was shooting   were ignoring    just  just lost  head   shot  apple    stupid roast pigs mouth   defiantly   did   says cinna carefully nothing   dont know  walked  after    without being dismissed gasps effie  dismissed myself  said  remember how  promised prim   really  try  win   feel like  ton  coal

see theyd   reveal  happened   training center     any worthwhile effect   population people  need  know   did   cant since its secret  itd   waste  effort says haymitch more likely theyll make your life hell   arena well theyve already promised     us any way says peeta very true says haymitch   realize  impossible has happened   actually cheered   haymitch picks   pork chop   fingers  makes effie frown  dunks    wine  rips off  hunk  meat  starts  chuckle  were  faces like  can feel  edges   mouth tilting  shocked terrified uh ridiculous some  them  image pops into  mind  man tripped backward into  bowl  punch haymitch guffaws    start laughing except effie although even  is suppressing  smile well  serves them right its  job  pay attention    just because  come  district twelve is no excuse  ignore  then  eyes dart around   shes said something totally outrageous im sorry  thats   think  says  no   particular ill   very bad score   scores only matter  theyre very good no  pays much attention   bad  mediocre ones    know  could  hiding your talents    low score  purpose people use  strategy said portia  hope thats how people interpret  four ill probably  says peeta   really is anything less impressive than watching  person pick   heavy ball  throw   couple  yards  almost landed   foot  grin  him  realize  im starving  cut off  piece  pork dunk   mashed potatoes  start eating its okay  family is safe    are safe no real harm has been done after dinner    sitting room  watch  scores announced  television first  show  photo   tribute then flash  score below

slopes down  dont particularly like  valleys make  feel trapped  want   high like   hills around district 12 where  can see  enemies approaching    no choice   keep going funny though  dont feel too bad  days  gorging myself  paid off ive got staying power even though im short  sleep being   woods is rejuvenating im glad   solitude even though its  illusion because im probably onscreen right now  consistently  off    are  many deaths  show  first day   tribute trekking through  woods isnt much  look    11 show  enough  let people know im alive uninjured    move    heaviest days  betting is  opening when  initial casualties come    cant compare   happens   field shrinks   handful  players its late afternoon when  begin  hear  cannons each shot represents  dead tribute  fighting must  finally stopped   cornucopia  never collect  bloodbath bodies until  killers  dispersed   opening day  dont even fire  cannons until  initial fightings over because its too hard  keep track   fatalities  allow myself  pause panting   count  shots  two three    until  reach eleven eleven dead   thirteen left  play  fingernails scrape   dried blood  boy  district 9 coughed into  face hes gone certainly  wonder  peeta has  lasted through  day ill know   few hours when  project  deads images into  sky   rest  us  see    sudden im overwhelmed   thought  peeta may  already lost bled white collected    process  being transported back   capitol   cleaned  redressed  shipped   simple wooden box back  district 12 no longer here heading home  try hard  remember   saw him once  action started   last image  can conjure  is peeta shaking  head   gong rang  maybe its better  hes gone already  had no confidence  could win     end    unpleasant task  killing him maybe its better  hes     good  slump down next   pack exhausted  need   through  anyway before night falls see     work    unhook  straps  can feel its sturdily made although  rather unfortunate color  orange  practically

twilight is closing    am ill  ease  trees are too thin  offer much concealment  layer  pine needles  muffles  footsteps also makes tracking animals harder when  need  trails  find water  im still heading downhill deeper  deeper into  valley  seems endless im hungry too   dont dare break into  precious store  crackers  beef yet instead  take  knife    work   pine tree cutting away  outer bark  scraping off  large handful   softer inner bark  slowly chew  stuff   walk along after  week   finest food   world its  little hard  choke down  ive eaten plenty  pine   life ill adjust quickly

food  abundance  water   lake torches  flashlights  weapons theyre itching  use  can only hope ive traveled far  fast enough     range before settling down  take  wire  set two twitchup snares   brush  know its risky   setting traps  food    fast  here   cant set snares   run still  walk another five minutes before making camp  pick  tree carefully  willow  terribly tall  set   clump  other willows offering concealment  those long flowing tresses  climb  sticking   stronger branches close   trunk  find  sturdy fork   bed  takes some doing   arrange  sleeping bag   relatively comfortable manner  place  backpack   foot   bag then slide  after    precaution  remove  belt loop    way around  branch   sleeping bag  refasten    waist now   roll over   sleep  wont  crashing   ground im small enough  tuck  top   bag over  head   put   hood  well  night falls  air is cooling quickly despite  risk  took  getting  backpack  know now  was  right choice  sleeping bag radiating back  preserving  body heat   invaluable im sure  are several other tributes whose biggest concern right now is how  stay warm whereas  may actually  able    few hours  sleep  only  wasnt  thirsty night has just come when  hear  anthem  proceeds  death recap through  branches  can see  seal   capitol  appears   floating   sky im actually viewing another screen  enormous  thats transported      disappearing hovercraft  anthem fades    sky goes dark   moment  home    watching full coverage  each  every killing  thats thought  give  unfair advantage   living tributes  instance   got  hands   bow  shot someone  secret   revealed   no here   arena   see are  same photographs  showed when  televised our training scores simple head shots  now instead  scores  post only district numbers  take  deep breath   face   eleven dead tributes begin  tick them off      fingers  first  appear is  girl  district 3  means   career tributes  1  2   survived no surprise  then  boy  4  didnt expect   usually   careers make

theres  girl  district 10 thats   capitol seal is back   final musical flourish then darkness   sounds   forest resume im relieved peetas alive  tell myself again     killed  winning  benefit  mother  prim  most  is   tell myself  explain  conflicting emotions  arise when  think  peeta  gratitude   gave   edge  professing  love     interview  anger   superiority   roof  dread   may come facetoface  any moment   arena eleven dead  none  district 12  try  work   is left five career tributes foxface thresh  rue rue   made  through  first day after   cant help feeling glad  makes ten  us  other three ill figure  tomorrow now when  is dark    traveled far   am nestled high   tree now  must try  rest  havent really slept  two days  then theres been  long days journey into  arena slowly  allow  muscles  relax  eyes  close  last thing  think is its lucky  dont snore snap  sound   breaking branch wakes  how long   been asleep four hours five  tip   nose is icy cold snap snap whats going   is   sound   branch under someones foot   sharp crack   coming   tree snap snap  judge    several hundred yards   right slowly noiselessly  turn myself   direction   few minutes theres nothing  blackness  some scuffling then  see  spark   small fire begins  bloom  pair  hands warms over flames   cant make  more than     bite  lip   scream every foul name  know   fire starter  are  thinking  fire 111 just  nightfall   been  thing those  battled   cornucopia   superior strength  surplus  supplies  couldnt possibly  been near enough  spot  flames then  now when theyve probably been combing  woods  hours looking  victims  might  well  waving  flag  shouting come     here  am  stones throw   biggest idiot   games strapped   tree  daring  flee since  general location has just been broadcast  any killer  cares  mean  know its cold  here   everybody has  sleeping bag  then  grit your teeth  stick   until dawn  lay smoldering   bag   next couple  hours really thinking    can     tree  wont   least problem taking   new neighbor  instinct has been  flee  fight  obviously  persons  hazard stupid people are dangerous    probably doesnt  much   way  weapons while ive got  excellent knife  sky is still dark   can feel  first signs  dawn approaching im beginning  think  meaning  person whose death im now devising    might actually  gone unnoticed then  hear  several pairs  feet breaking into  run  fire starter must  dozed off theyre   before  can escape  know its  girl now  can tell   pleading  agonized scream  follows then theres laughter  congratulations  several voices someone cries  twelve down  eleven    gets  round  appreciative hoots  theyre fighting   pack im  really surprised often alliances are formed   early stages   games  strong band together  hunt down  weak then when  tension becomes too great begin  turn   another  dont   wonder too hard  has made  alliance  11   remaining career tributes  districts 12  4 two boys  three girls  ones  lunched together   moment  hear them checking  girl  supplies  can tell   comments theyve found nothing good  wonder   victim is rue  quickly dismiss  thought shes much too bright   building  fire like  better clear    can   body before  starts stinking im almost certain thats  brutish boy  district 2  are murmurs  assent  then   horror  hear  pack heading toward     know im here how could   im well concealed   clump  trees  least while  sun stays down then  black sleeping bag  turn  camouflage  trouble   just keep moving   pass    gone   minute   careers stop   clearing  ten yards   tree   flashlights torches  can see  arm here  boot  through  breaks   branches  turn  stone  even daring  breathe   spotted  no  yet  can tell   words  minds are elsewhere shouldnt   heard  cannon  now id  yes nothing  prevent them  going  immediately unless  isnt dead shes dead  stuck  myself then where s  cannon someone should  back make sure  jobs done yeah  dont want    track  down twice  said shes dead  argument breaks  until  tribute silences  others were wasting time ill  finish   lets move   almost fall    tree  voice belongs  peeta thank goodness  had  foresight  belt myself  ive rolled sideways off  fork  im facing  ground held  place   belt  hand   feet straddling  pack inside  sleeping bag braced against  trunk  must  been some rustling when  tipped sideways   careers  been too caught    own argument  catch    then lover boy says  boy  district 2 see  yourself  just   glimpse  peeta lit   torch heading back   girl   fire  face is swollen  bruises theres  bloody bandage   arm    sound   gait hes limping somewhat  remember him shaking him  head telling     into  fight   supplies when  along  along hed planned  throw himself into  thick  things just  opposite   haymitch had mid him   okay  can stomach  seeing  those supplies was tempting    other thing  teaming    career wolf pack  hunt down  rest  us no   district 12  think  doing such  thing career tributes are overly vicious arrogant better fed  only because theyre  capitols lapdogs universally solidly hated    those   own districts  can imagine  things theyre saying  him back home now  peeta had  gall  talk    disgrace obviously  noble boy   rooftop was playing just  more game        last   eagerly watch  night skies  signs   death   dont kill him first myself  career tributes are silent until  gets   ear shot then use hushed voices why dont  just kill him now    over  let him tag along whats  harm  hes handy   knife is  thats news   lot  interesting things im learning   friend peeta today besides hes our best chance  finding   takes   moment  register    theyre referring  is  why  think  bought into  sappy romance stuff  might  seemed pretty simpleminded   every time  think   spinning around   dress  want  puke wish  knew how  got  eleven bet  lover boy knows  sound  peeta returning silences them was  dead asks  boy  district 2 no   is now says peeta just then  cannon fires ready  move   career pack sets off   run just  dawn begins  break  birdsong fills  air  remain   awkward position muscles trembling  exertion   while longer then hoist myself back onto  branch  need   down   going    moment  lie  digesting  ive heard  only is peeta   careers hes helping them find   simpleminded girl  has   taken seriously because   eleven because  can use  bow  arrow  peeta knows better than anyone   hasnt told them yet is  saving  information because  knows its   keeps him alive is  still pretending  love    audience  is going    head suddenly  birds fall silent then  gives  high pitched warning call  single note just like   gale   heard when  redheaded avox girl was caught high above  dying campfire  hovercraft materializes  set  huge metal teeth drops down slowly gently  dead tribute girl is lifted into  hovercraft then  vanishes  birds resume  song move  whisper  myself  wriggle    sleeping bag roll    place    pack  take  deep breath while ive been concealed  darkness   sleeping bag   willow branches  has probably been difficult   cameras    good shot    know  must  tracking  now though  minute  hit  ground im guaranteed  closeup  audience   been beside themselves knowing  was   tree   overheard  careers talking   discovered peeta was  them until  work  exactly how  want  play  id better  least act  top  things  perplexed certainly  confused  frightened no  need  look  step ahead   game    slide    foliage  into  dawn light  pause  second giving  cameras time  lock   then  cock  head slightly   side  give  knowing smile  let them figure    means im   take off when  think   snares maybe its imprudent  check them   others  close    too many years  hunting  guess   lure  possible meat im rewarded   fine rabbit  no time ive cleaned  gutted  animal leaving  head feet tail skin  innards under  pile  leaves im wishing   fire eating raw rabbit can give  rabbit fever  lesson  learned  hard way when  think   dead tribute  hurry back   camp sure enough  coals   dying fire are still hot  cut   rabbit fashion  spit   branches  set  over  coals im glad   cameras now  want sponsors  see  can hunt  im  good bet because  wont  lured into traps  easily   others   hunger while  rabbit cooks  grind  part   charred branch  set  camouflaging  orange pack  black tones  down   feel  layer  mud  definitely help  course   mud id need water  pull   gear grab  spit kick some dirt over  coals  take off   opposite direction  careers went  eat half  rabbit    then wrap   leftovers   plastic  later  meat stops  grumbling   stomach  does little  quench  thirst water is  top priority now   hike along  feel certain im still holding  screen   capitol  im careful  continue  hide  emotions    good time claudius templesmith must  having   guest commentators dissecting peetas behavior  reaction   make    has peeta revealed  true colors how does  affect  betting odds   lose sponsors   even  sponsors yes  feel certain     least did certainly peeta has thrown  wrench into our star crossed lover dynamic  has  maybe since  hasnt spoken much    can still  some mileage    maybe people  think its something  plotted together   seem like  amuses  now  sun rises   sky  even through  canopy  seems overly bright  coat  lips  some grease   rabbit  try  keep  panting  its no use its only been  day  im dehydrating fast  try  think  everything  know  finding water  runs downhill   fact continuing down into  valley isnt  bad thing   could just locate  game trail  spot  particularly green patch  vegetation these might help  along  nothing seems  change theres just  slight gradual slope  birds  sameness   trees   day wears   know im headed  trouble  little urine ive been able  pass is  dark brown  head is aching  theres  dry patch   tongue  refuses  moisten  sun hurts  eyes   dig   sunglasses  when  put them    something funny   vision   just stuff them back   pack its late afternoon when  think ive found help  spot  cluster  berry bushes  hurry  strip  fruit  suck  sweet juices   skins  just  im holding them   lips    hard look  them   thought were blueberries   slightly different shape  when  break  open  insides are bloodred  dont recognize these berries perhaps  are edible  im guessing  is some evil trick   part   gamemakers even  plant instructor   training center made  point  telling us  avoid berries unless  were 100 percent sure  werent toxic something  already knew  im  thirsty  takes  reminder  give   strength  fling them away fatigue is beginning  settle    its   usual tiredness  follows  long hike    stop  rest frequently although  know  only cure   ails  requires continued searching  try  new tactic climbing  tree  high   dare   shaky state  look  any signs  water   far   can see  any direction theres  same unrelenting stretch  forest determined    until nightfall  walk until im stumbling over  own feet exhausted  haul myself  into  tree  belt myself  ive no appetite   suck   rabbit bone just  give  mouth something   night falls  anthem plays  high   sky  see  picture   girl  was apparently  district 8   peeta went back  finish off  fear   career pack is minor compared   burning thirst besides  were heading away     now  too    rest   scarcity  water  may even  had  return   lake  refills maybe  is  only course    well morning brings distress  heads throbs  every beat   heart simple movements send stabs  pain through  joints  fall rather than jump   tree  takes several minutes    assemble  gear somewhere inside   know  is wrong  should  acting  more caution moving  more urgency   mind seems foggy  forming  plan is hard  lean back against  trunk   tree  finger gingerly stroking  sandpaper surface   tongue   assess  options how can   water return   lake no good id never make  hope  rain theres   cloud   sky keep looking yes  is  only chance  then another thought hits    surge  anger  follows brings    senses haymitch  could send  water press  button    delivered     silver parachute  minutes  know  must  sponsors  least   two  could afford  pint  liquid   yes its pricey  these people theyre made  money  theyll  betting    well perhaps haymitch doesnt realize how deep  need is     voice  loud   dare water  wait hopefully   parachute  descend   sky  nothing is forthcoming something is wrong am  deluded  having sponsors  has peetas behavior made them  hang back no  dont believe  theres someone    wants  buy  water only haymitch is refusing  let   through   mentor  gets  control  flow  gifts   sponsors  know  hates  hes made  clear enough  enough  let  die    cant   can    mentor mistreats  tributes hell  held accountable   viewers   people back  district 12 even haymitch wouldnt risk          fellow traders   hob   dont think theyd welcome him back    let  die  way  then where     liquor   is  trying  make  suffer  defying him is  directing   sponsors toward peeta is  just too drunk  even notice whats going    moment somehow  dont believe    dont believe hes trying  kill  off  neglect either  has  fact   own unpleasant way genuinely been trying  prepare    then  is going   bury  face   hands theres no danger  tears now  couldnt produce   save  life  is haymitch doing despite  anger hatred  suspicions  small voice   back   head whispers  answer maybe hes sending   message  says  message saying  then  know theres only  good reason haymitch

know  havent been   part   woods before  were no sizable rocks like   im sheltering against   earlier travels where are  gamemakers driving  back   lake   whole new terrain filled  new dangers  had just found  few hours  peace   pond when  attack began    any way  could travel parallel   fire  work  way back    source  water  least  wall  fire must   end   wont burn indefinitely  because  gamemakers couldnt keep  fueled  because again   invite accusations  boredom   audience   could  back behind  fire line  could avoid meeting    careers ive just decided  try  loop back around although   require miles  travel away   inferno  then  very circuitous route back when  first fireball blasts into  rock  two feet   head  spring   under  ledge energized  renewed fear  game has taken  twist

only  size   apple  packs tremendous power  contact every sense   goes into overdrive   need  survive takes over theres no time  judge   move is  correct  when theres  hiss  act  die something keeps  moving forward though  lifetime  watching  hunger games lets  know  certain areas   arena are rigged  certain attacks     can just  away   section  might  able  move   reach   launchers  might also then fall straight into  pit  vipers   cant worry   now how long  scramble along dodging  fireballs  cant    attacks finally begin  abate  is good because im retching again  time its  acidic substance  scalds  throat  makes its way into  nose  well im forced  stop   body convulses trying desperately  rid itself   poisons ive been sucking  during  attack  wait   next hiss  next signal  bolt  doesnt

district eleven youd   bit more  eat than us  know since  grow  food   rues eyes widen oh no were  allowed  eat  crops  arrest   something  ask  whip   make everyone else watch says rue  mayors very strict    can tell   expression  its   uncommon  occurrence  public whippings  rare thing  district 12 although occasionally  occurs technically gale   could  whipped   daily basis  poaching   woods well technically  could   whole lot worse except   officials buy our meat besides our mayor madges father doesnt seem   much taste  such events maybe being  least prestigious poorest most ridiculed district   country has its advantages such  being largely ignored   capitol  long   produce our coal quotas      coal  want rue asks no  answer just   buy  whatever  track   our boots  feed us  bit extra during harvest   people can keep going longer says rue dont      school  ask  during harvest everyone works then says rue its interesting hearing   life    little communication  anyone outside our district  fact  wonder   gamemakers are blocking  our conversation because even though  information seems harmless  dont want people  different districts  know   another  rues suggestion  lay   our food  plan ahead shes seen most  mine   add  last couple  crackers  beef strips   pile shes gathered quite  collection  roots nuts greens  even some berries  roll  unfamiliar berry   fingers  sure  is safe oh yes   them back home ive been eating them  days  says popping  handful   mouth  tentatively bite into   its  good  our blackberries taking rue    ally seems  better choice   time  divide  our food supplies   case were separated well both  set   few days apart   food rue has  small water skin  homemade slingshot   extra pair  socks  also has  sharp shard  rock  uses   knife  know its

sun   make  harder  see     shrug these arent  sun theyre  darkness exclaims rue sometimes when  harvest through  night theyll pass   few pairs  those  us highest   trees where  torchlight doesnt reach  time  boy martin  tried  keep  pair hid    pants  killed him   spot  killed  boy  taking these   yes  everyone knew  was no danger martin wasnt right   head  mean  still acted like  threeyearold  just wanted  glasses  play  says rue hearing  makes  feel like district 12 is some sort  safe haven  course people keel over  starvation   time   cant imagine  peacekeepers murdering  simpleminded child theres  little girl   greasy saes grandkids  wanders around  hob shes  quite right  shes treated   sort  pet people toss  scraps  things    these   ask rue taking  glasses  let  see  complete darkness says rue try them tonight when  sun goes down  give rue some matches   makes sure   plenty  leaves  case  stings flare  again  extinguish our fire  head upstream until its almost nightfall where   sleep  ask    trees  nods  just your jacket rue holds   extra pair  socks   these   hands  think  how cold  nights  been  can share  sleeping bag   want well both easily fit  face lights   can tell  is more than  dared hope   pick  fork high   tree  settle    night just   anthem begins  play  were no deaths today rue  only woke  today how many nights did  missthe anthem should block  our words  still  whisper  even take  precaution  covering  lips   hand  dont want  audience  know  im planning  tell   peeta taking  cue    does  same two  says  girls  districts   four are dead theres ten  us left something strange happened  least  think  did  might  been  tracker j acker venom making  imagine things    know  boy   district peeta  think  saved  life   was   careers hes   them now  says ive spied   base camp   lake  made  back before  collapsed   stingers  hes   maybe  did save   had  run  dont answer   fact peeta did save  im   debt again   cant  paid back   did  was  probably just part   act  know  make people think hes  love   oh says rue thoughtfully  didnt think  was  act course  is    worked    our mentor  anthem ends   sky goes dark lets try  these glasses  pull   glasses  slip them  rue wasnt kidding  can see everything   leaves   trees   skunk strolling through  bushes  good fifty feet away  could kill   here   had  mind   could kill anyone  wonder  else got  pair  these    careers  two pairs  theyve got everything down   lake rue says  theyre  strong were strong too   just   different way  are  can shoot  says  can    can feed yourself can   ask  dont need     those supplies rue says   didnt   supplies were gone how long   last    mean its  hunger games right  katniss theyre  hungry says rue no theyre  thats  problem  agree    first time    plan  plan  isnt motivated   need  flight  evasion  offensive plan  think were going    fix  rue rue has decided  trust  wholeheartedly  know  because  soon   anthem finishes  snuggles  against   falls asleep nor    any misgivings     take no particular precautions  shed wanted  dead     had   was disappear   tree without pointing   tracker jacker nest needling    very back   mind is  obvious both  us cant win these games  since  odds are still against either  us surviving  manage  ignore  thought besides im distracted   latest idea   careers   supplies somehow rue   must find  way  destroy  food im pretty sure feeding themselves    tremendous struggle traditionally  career tributes strategy is   hold    food early   work    years when    protected  well  year  pack  hideous reptiles destroyed  another  gamemakers flood washed  away those are usually  years  tributes  other districts  won   careers  been better red growing  is actually   disadvantage because  dont know how   hungry   way rue     im too exhausted  begin any detailed plan tonight  wounds recovering  mind still  bit foggy   venom   warmth  rue   side  head cradled   shoulder  given   sense  security  realize   first time how very lonely ive been   arena how comforting  presence  another human being can   give    drowsiness resolving  tomorrow  tables  turn tomorrow its  careers     watch  backs  boom   cannon jolts  awake  skys streaked  light  birds already chattering rue perches   branch across    hands cupping something  wait listening  more shots   arent any    think  was  cant help thinking  peeta  dont know  could  been any   others says rue  guess well know tonight whos left again  ask  boy  district  both tributes  two  boy  three thresh      peeta says rue thats eight wait   boy  ten     bad leg  makes nine theres someone else  neither  us can remember   is  wonder how  last  died says rue no telling  its good  us  death should hold  crowd   bit maybe well  time   something before  gamemakers decide things  been moving too slowly   whats  your hands breakfast says rue  holds them  revealing two big eggs  kind are those  ask  sure theres  marshy area over  way some kind  waterbird  says itd  nice  cook them  neither  us wants  risk  fire  guess is  tribute  died today was  victim   careers  means theyve recovered enough   back   games  each suck   insides   egg eat  rabbit leg  some berries its  good breakfast anywhere ready      pulling   pack   says rue    way  bounces   can tell shes   whatever  propose today  take   careers food   really how  can see  glint  excitement   eyes   way shes exactly  opposite  prim  whom adventures are  ordeal no idea come  well figure   plan while  hunt    dont  much hunting done though because im too busy getting every scrap  information  can   rue   careers base shes only been   spy  them briefly  shes observant   set   camp beside  lake  supply stash is  thirty yards away during  day theyve been leaving another tribute  boy  district 3  watch over  supplies  boy  district three  ask hes working  them yes  stays   camp fulltime  got stung too when  drew  tracker j ackers    lake says rue  guess  agreed  let him live   acted   guard  hes  very big  weapons does    ask  much   could see  spear  might  able  hold  few  us off    thresh could kill him easilysays rue   foods just    open    nods somethings  quite right   whole setup  know   couldnt tell  exactly says ruekatniss even   could    food how    rid   burn  dump    lake soak   fuel  poke rue   belly just like   prim eat   giggles dont worry 111 think  something destroying things is much easier than making them   while  dig roots  gather berries  greens  devise  strategy  hushed voices   come  know rue  oldest  six kids fiercely protective   siblings  gives  rations   younger ones  forages   meadows   district where  peacekeepers are far less obliging than ours rue  when  ask    loves most   world replies   things music music    our world  rank music somewhere between hair ribbons  rainbows  terms  usefulness  least  rainbow gives   tip   weather    lot  time    sing  home  work too thats why  love your pin  says pointing   mockingjay  ive again forgotten    mocking ays  ask oh yes    few  are  special friends  can sing back  forth  hours  carry messages    says    mean   im usually  highest  im  first

pinning  mockingjay back   shirt maybe  should just stick    lunch    plan  early afternoon  are poised  carry    help rue collect  place  wood   first two campfires  third shell  time    own  decide  meet afterward   site where  ate our first meal together  stream should help guide  back   before  leave  make sure rues well stocked  food  matches  even insist  take  sleeping bag  case its  possible  rendezvous  nightfall    wont   cold  asks    pick  another bag down   lake    know stealing isnt illegal here     grin   last minute rue decides  teach   mockingj ay signal    gives  indicate  days work is done  might  work    hear  mockingjays singing  youll know im okay only  cant  back right away are  many mockingjays here  ask havent  seen them theyve got nests everywhere  says    admit  havent noticed okay then   goes according  plan 111 see   dinner   unexpectedly rue throws  arms around   only hesitate  moment before  hug  back   careful  says    too    turn  head back   stream feeling somehow worried  rue being killed  rue  being killed   two  us being left  last  leaving rue alone  leaving prim alone back home no prim has  mother  gale   baker  has promised

nothing  him   costume   training score   interview even now   sits  fiddling  some kind  plastic box hes easily ignored   presence   large  domineering companions   must   some value   wouldnt  bothered  let him live still seeing him only adds   sense  unease over why  careers  possibly leave him   guard why   allowed him  live    four tributes seem  still  recovering   tracker jacker attack even  here  can see  large swollen lumps   bodies  must   had  sense  remove  stingers    did  known   leaves  healed them apparently whatever medicines  found   cornucopia  been ineffective  cornucopia sits  its original position  its insides  been picked clean most   supplies held  crates burlap sacks  plastic bins are piled neatly   pyramid   seems  questionable distance   camp others

whole setup is completely perplexing  distance  netting   presence   boy  district 3  things  sure destroying those supplies is  going    simple   looks some other factor is  play here  id better stay put until  figure    is  guess is  pyramid is boobytrapped  some manner  think  concealed pits descending nets  thread  when broken sends  poisonous dart into your heart really  possibilities are endless while  am mulling over  options  hear cato shout  hes pointing    woods far beyond   without turning  know  rue must  set  first campfire wed made sure  gather enough green wood  make  smoke noticeable  careers begin  arm themselves  once  argument breaks  its loud enough    hear   concerns whether    boy  district 3 should stay  accompany them hes coming  need him   woods   jobs done here anyway no  can touch those supplies says cato   lover boy says  boy  district 1  keep telling  forget  him  know where  cut him its  miracle  hasnt bled  death yet  any rate hes  no shape  raid us says cato  peeta is     woods wounded badly   am still   dark   motivated him  betray  careers come  says cato  thrusts  spear into  hands   boy  district 3   head off   direction   fire  last thing  hear   enter  woods is cato saying when  find   kill    own way  no  interferes somehow  dont think hes talking  rue  didnt drop  nest  tracker jackers  him  stay put   half  hour   trying  figure       supplies   advantage     bow  arrow is distance  could send  flaming arrow into  pyramid easily enough im  good enough shot    through those openings   net  theres no guarantee   catch more likely itd just burn itself   then  id  achieved nothing  given them far too much information  myself   was here     accomplice   can use  bow  arrow  accuracy theres no alternative im going      closer  see   cant discover  exactly protects  supplies  fact im just   reveal myself when  movement catches  eye several hundred yards   right  see someone emerge   woods   second  think its rue  then  recognize foxface shes    couldnt remember  morning creeping  onto  plain when  decides its safe  runs   pyramid  quick small steps just before  reaches  circle  supplies   been littered around  pyramid  stops searches  ground  carefully places  feet   spot then  begins  approach  pyramid  strange little hops sometimes landing   foot teetering slightly sometimes risking  few steps   point  launches    air over  small barrel  lands poised   tiptoes   overshot slightly   momentum throws  forward  hear  give  sharp squeal   hands hit  ground  nothing happens   moment shes regained  feet  continues until  has reached  bulk   supplies  im right   booby trap  its clearly more complex than  had imagined  was right   girl too how wily is    discovered  path into  food    able  replicate   neatly  fills  pack taking  few items   variety  containers crackers   crate  handful  apples   burlap sack  hangs suspended   rope off  side   bin  only  handful  each  enough  tip off   food is missing  enough  cause suspicion  then shes doing  odd little dance back    circle  scampering into  woods again safe  sound  realize im grinding  teeth  frustration foxface has confirmed  id already guessed   sort  trap   laid  requires such dexterity has  many trigger points why did  squeal    hands made contact   earth youd  thought  slowly  begins  dawn   youd  thought  very ground was going  explode its mined  whisper  explains everything  careers willingness  leave  supplies foxfaces reaction  involvement   boy  district 3 where    factories where  make televisions  automobiles

tributes into  arena  ground around  has been dug   patted back down  land mines were disabled after  sixty seconds  stood   plates   boy  district 3 must  managed  reactivate them ive never seen anyone   games    bet  came   shock even   gamemakers well hurray   boy  district 3  putting  over  them   am  supposed   now obviously  cant  strolling into  mess without blowing myself skyhigh   sending   burning arrow thats more laughable than ever  mines are set off  pressure  doesnt     lot either  year  girl dropped  token  small wooden ball while  was   plate   literally had  scrape bits   off  ground  arms pretty good  might  able  chuck some rocks    set off  maybe  mine  could start  chain reaction  could    boy  district 3  placed  mines  such  way   single mine   disturb  others thereby protecting  supplies  ensuring  death   invader even   only blew   mine id draw  careers back down    sure  anyway  am  thinking theres  net clearly strung  deflect any such attack besides  id really need is  throw  thirty rocks    once setting off  big chain reaction demolishing  whole lot  glance back    woods  smoke  rues second fire is wafting toward  sky  now  careers  probably begun  suspect some sort  trick time is running   is  solution    know  is   can only focus hard enough  stare   pyramid  bins  crates too heavy  topple over   arrow maybe  contains cooking oil   burning

body    put two  two together yet figured   blew   supplies  killed  fellow career possibly  think thresh did  wouldnt   more likely  revenge rues death than   being   same district    ever took any interest      foxface did  hang around  watch  blow   supplies no when  caught  laughing   ashes  next morning  was   someone had given   lovely surprise  doubt  think peeta has lit  signal fire catos

think  stand  chance  doing  now winning its  just having  arrows  outsmarting  careers  few times although those things help something happened when  was holding rues hand watching  life drain    now  am determined  revenge   make  loss unforgettable   can only    winning  thereby making myself unforgettable  overcook  birds hoping someone  show   shoot  no  does maybe  other tributes are

inducement  gather  fight sometimes  is  feast  sometimes theres nothing   loaf  stale bread   tributes  compete   wouldnt     food   could   ideal time  take   few competitors claudius templesmiths voice booms down  overhead congratulating  six  us  remain   is  inviting us   feast hes saying something very confusing theres been  rule change   games  rule change   itself is mind bending since

claudius pauses    knows were  getting   repeats  change again  news sinks  two tributes can win  year  theyre   same district both can live both  us can live before  can stop myself  call  peetas

add several egg size hot stones   water im  first  admit im  much   cook  since soup mainly involves tossing everything   pot  waiting its    better dishes  mince groosling until its practically mush  mash some  rues roots fortunately theyve both been roasted already   mostly need   heated  already between  sunlight   rocks  waters warm  put   meat  roots swap  fresh rocks   find something green  spice    little before long  discover  tuft  chives growing   base  some rocks perfect  chop them very fine  add them   pot switch   rocks again put   lid  let  whole thing stew ive seen very few

vial haymitch has done  hes gotten  medicine  dont know how persuaded some gaggle  romantic fools  sell  jewels   can save peeta its such  tiny vial though  must  very strong  cure someone  ill  peeta  ripple  doubt runs through   uncork  vial  take  deep sniff  spirits fall   sickly sweet scent just   sure  place  drop   tip   tongue theres no question its sleep syrup its  common medicine  district 12 cheap  medicine goes  very addictive almost everyones had  dose   time  another   some   bottle  home  mother gives   hysterical patients  knock them   stitch   bad wound  quiet  minds  just  help someone  pain  through  night  only takes  little  vial  size could knock peeta    full day   good is  im  furious im   throw haymitchs last offering into  stream when  hits   full day thats more than  need  mash   handful  berries   taste wont   noticeable  add some mint leaves  good measure then  head back    cave ive brought   treat  found  new patch  berries  little farther

consciousness even   fades away  can see   eyes  ive done is unforgivable  sit back   heels  look  him   mixture  sadness  satisfaction  stray berry stains  chin   wipe  away  cant lie peeta   even though  cant hear   doesnt matter  rest  panem can   remaining hours before nightfall  gather rocks    best  camouflage  opening   cave its  slow  arduous process  after  lot  sweating  shifting things around im pretty pleased   work  cave now appears   part   larger pile  rocks like  many   vicinity  can still crawl   peeta through  small opening  its undetectable   out« side thats good because ill need  share  sleeping bag again tonight also   dont make  back   feast peeta   hidden   entirely imprisoned although  doubt  can hang  much longer without medicine   die   feast district

raisins  makes  drink plenty  water  rubs some warmth back into  feet  wraps them   jacket before tucking  sleeping bag back  around  chin your boots  socks are still damp   weathers  helping much  says theres  clap  thunder   see lightning electrify  sky through  opening   rocks rain drips through several holes   ceiling  peeta has built  sort  canopy over  head  upper body  wedging  square  plastic into  rock above   wonder  brought   storm  mean whos  target says peeta cato  thresh   without thinking foxface     den somewhere  clove  cut   then  voice trails off  know cloves dead  saw    sky last night  says did  kill  no thresh broke  skull   rock   lucky  didnt catch  too says peeta  memory   feast returns fullforce   feel sick  did   let   then  course    tell him  things ive kept  myself because  was too sick  ask   wasnt ready  relive anyway like  explosion   ear  rues dying   boy  district 1   bread    leads   happened  thresh  how  was paying off  debt  sorts  let   because  didnt want  owe  anything asks peeta  disbelief yes  dont expect   understand  youve always had enough   youd lived   seam  wouldnt   explain    dont try obviously im too dim    its like  bread how  never seem   over owing       bread   when  were kids  says  think  can let    mean  just brought  back   dead   didnt know   had never even spoken besides its  first gift thats always  hardest  pay back  wouldnt even  been here      hadnt helped  then   why did  anyway why  know why peeta says  give  head  slight painful shake haymitch said   take  lot  convincing haymitch  ask whats  got     nothing peeta says  cato  thresh huh  guess its too much  hope  theyll simultaneously destroy each other   thought only upsets   think   like thresh  think hed  our friend back  district twelve   then lets hope cato kills him   dont   says peeta grimly  dont want cato  kill thresh    dont want anyone else  die   is absolutely   kind  thing  victors  around saying   arena despite  best efforts  can feel tears starting  pool   eyes peeta looks    concern  is  are    lot  pain  give him another answer because  is equally true  can  taken   brief moment  weakness instead   terminal   want   home peeta   plaintively like  small child    promise  says  bends over  give   kiss  want   home now   tell     back  sleep  dream  home   11    real before  know itlie says okay okay  whisper wake    need   keep watch im good  rested thanks    haymitch besides  knows how long   last  says  does  mean  storm  brief respite ii brings us  games themselves  dont know  im ion sad  tired  ask its evening when peeta wakes  again  rain has turned   downpour sending streams  water through our ceiling where earlier  had been only drips peeta has placed  broth pot under  worst   repositioned  plastic  deflect most      feel  bit better able  sit  without getting too dizzy  im absolutely famished  is peeta its clear hes been waiting    wake   eat  is eager   started theres  much left two pieces  groosling  small mishmash  roots   handful  dried fruit should  try  ration  peeta asks no lets just finish   grooslings getting old anyway   last thing  need is   sick offspoilt food   dividing  food into two equal piles  tryand eat slowly  were both  hungry were done   couple  minutes  stomach is  no way satisfied tomorrows  hunting day    wont  much help   peeta says ive never hunted before ill kill   cook     can always gather  wish  was some sort  bread bush   says peeta  bread  sent   district eleven was still warm     sigh here chew these  hand him  couple  mint leaves  pop  few   own mouth its hard  even see  projection   sky  its clear enough  know  were no more deaths today  cato  thresh havent had   yet where did thresh   mean whats   far side   circle  ask peeta  field  far   can see its full  grasses  high   shoulders  dont know maybe some  them are grain  are patches  different colors   are no paths says peeta  bet some  them are grain  bet thresh knows  ones too   did     no nobody really wanted  track thresh down   grass  has  sinister feeling   every time  look   field   can think  are hidden things snakes  rabid animals  quicksand peeta says  could  anything    dont    peetas words remind    warnings  give us   going beyond  fence  district 121 cant help   moment comparing him  gale   see  field   potential source  food  well   threat thresh certainly did its   peetas soft exactly  hes proved hes   coward   are things  dont question too much  guess when your home always smells like baking bread whereas gale questions everything   peeta think   irreverent banter  passes between us   break  law each day   shock him  things    panem gales tirades against  capitol maybe  is  bread bush   field   maybe thats why thresh looks better fed now than when  started  games either   hes got very generous sponsors says peeta  wonder  wed      haymitch  send us some bread  raise  eyebrows before  remember  doesnt know   message haymitch sent us  couple  nights ago  kiss equals  pot  broth its   sort  thing  can blurt  either    thoughts aloud   tipping off  audience   romance has been fabricated  play   sympathies    result  no food   somehow believably ive got   things back  track something simple  start   reach   take  hand well  probably used   lot  resources helping  knock     mischievously yeah   says peeta entwining  fingers  mine dont try something like  again    ask    cant think  anything good just give   minute whats  problem     grin  problem is were both still alive  only reinforces  idea  your mind   did  right thingsays peeta  did   right thing   no just dont katniss  grip tightens hurting  hand  theres real anger   voice dont die    wont  doing  any favors  right im startled   intensity  recognize  excellent opportunity  getting food   try  keep  maybe  did   myself peeta did  ever think   maybe  arent  only    worries      like   fumble im   smooth  words  peeta  while  was talking  idea  actually losing peeta hit  again   realized how much  dont want him  die  its    sponsors  its     happen back home  its  just   dont want   alone its him    want  lose  boy   bread   katniss  says softly  wish  could pull  shutters closed blocking   moment   prying eyes  panem even   means losing food whatever im feeling its no ones business  mine thats exactly  kind  topic haymitch told   steer clear    evasively although haymitch never said anything   kind  fact hes probably cursing   right now  dropping  ball during such  emotionally charged moment  peeta somehow catches  then 111 just   fill   blanks myself  says  moves     is  first kiss  were both fully aware  neither  us hobbled  sickness  pain  simply unconscious our lips neither burning  fever  icy cold  is  first kiss where  actually feel stirring inside  chest warm  curious  is  first kiss  makes  want another   dont   well     second kiss  its just  light    tip   nose because peetas been distracted  think your wound is bleeding again come  lie down its bedtime anyway  says  socks are dry enough  wear now  make peeta put  jacket back   damp cold seems  cut right down   bones   must  half frozen  insist  taking  first watch too although neither  us think its likely anyone  come   weather   wont agree unless im   bag too  im shivering  hard  its pointless  object  stark contrast  two nights ago when  felt peeta was  million miles away im struck   immediacy now   settle   pulls  head down  use  arm   pillow  other rests protectively over  even when  goes  sleep no  has held  like   such  long time since  father died   stopped trusting  mother no  elses arms  made  feel  safe   aid   glasses  lie watching  drips  water splatter   cave floor rhythmic  lulling several times  drift off briefly  then snap awake guilty  angry  myself after three  four hours  cant help     rouse peeta because  cant keep  eyes open  doesnt seem  mind tomorrow when its dry 111 find us  place  high   trees  can both sleep  peace  promise   drift off  tomorrow is no better  terms  weather  deluge continues    gamemakers are intent  washing us  away  thunders  powerful  seems  shake  ground peetas considering heading  anyway  scavenge  food   tell him   storm    pointless  wont  able  see three feet  front   face  hell only end  getting soaked   skin   troubles  knows im right   gnawing  our stomachs is becoming painful  day drags  turning into evening  theres no break   weather haymitch is our only hope  nothing is forthcoming either  lack  money everything  cost  exorbitant amount  because hes dissatisfied  our performance probably  latter id   first  admit were  exactly riveting today starving weak  injuries trying   reopen wounds were sitting huddled together wrapped   sleeping bag yes  mostly  keep warm  most exciting thing either  us does is nap im  really sure how  ramp   romance  kiss last night was nice  working   another  take some forethought  are girls   seam some   merchant girls too  navigate these waters  easily  ive never had much time  use   anyway just  kiss isnt enough anymore clearly because   was wed  gotten food last night  instincts tell  haymitch isnt just looking  physical affection  wants something more personal  sort  stuff  was trying     tell  myself when  were practicing   interview im rotten    peetas  maybe  best approach is   him talking peeta   lightly  said   interview youd had  crush   forever when did forever start oh lets see  guess  first day  school  were five  had   red plaid dress  your hair  was  two braids instead    father pointed   when  were waiting  line  peeta says your father why  ask  said see  little girl  wanted  marry  mother   ran off   coal miner peeta says  youre making    exclaim no true story peeta says   said  coal miner why did  want  coal miner   could ve had    said because when  sings even  birds stop  listen thats true    mean  did   im stunned  surprisingly moved thinking   baker telling   peeta  strikes    own reluctance  sing  own dismissal  music might  really    think its  waste  time  might  because  reminds  too much   father   day  music assembly  teacher asked  knew  valley song your hand shot right    air  stood     stool  had  sing   us   swear every bird outside  windows fell silent peeta says oh please   laughing no  happened  right when your song ended  knew just like your mother  was  goner peeta says then   next eleven years  tried  work   nerve  talk   without success  add without success    way  name being drawn   reaping was  real piece  luck says peeta   moment im almost foolishly happy  then confusion sweeps over  because were supposed   making   stuff playing  being  love  actually being  love  peetas story has  ring  truth    part   father   birds   did sing  first day  school although  dont remember  song   red plaid dress  was   handmedown  prim  got washed  rags after  fathers death   explain another thing too why peeta took  beating  give   bread   awful hollow day   those details are true could    true    remarkable memory   haltingly  remember everything   says peeta tucking  loose strand  hair behind  ear youre    wasnt paying attention  am now   well  dont  much competition here  says  want  draw away  close those shutters again   know  cant its    can hear haymitch whispering   ear      swallow hard    words   dont  much competition anywhere   time its   leans  our lips  just barely touched when  clunk outside makes us jump  bow comes   arrow ready  fly  theres no other sound peeta peers through  rocks  then gives  whoop before  can stop him lies    rain then handing something     silver parachute attached   basket  rip  open  once  inside theres  feast fresh rolls goat cheese apples  best    tureen   incredible lamb stew  wild rice  very dish  told caesar flickerman was  most impressive thing  capitol had  offer peeta wriggles back inside  face lit  like  sun  guess haymitch finally got tired  watching us starve  guess   answer    head  can hear haymitch s smug  slightly exasperated words yes thats  im looking lot sweetheart every cell   body wants   dig into  stew  cram  handful  handful into  mouth  peetas voice stops   better take  slow   stew remember  first night   train  rich food made  sick   wasnt even starving then youre right   could just inhale  whole thingi  regretfully   dont  are quite sensible  each   roll half  apple   egg size serving  stew  rice  make myself eat  stew  tiny spoonfuls  even sent us silverware  plates savoring each bite when  finish  stare longingly   dish  want more  too tell    wait  hour   stays down then   another serving peeta says agreed   its going    long hour maybe   long says peeta  was   were saying just before  food arrived something   no competition best thing  ever happened    dont remember  last part   hoping its too dim  here   cameras  pick   blush oh thats right thats  was thinking  says scoot over im freezing  make room  him   sleeping bag  lean back against  cave wall  head   shoulder  arms wrapped around   can feel haymitch nudging   keep   act  since  were five  never even noticed any other girls  ask him no  noticed just  every girl  none  them made  lasting impression    says im sure   thrill your parents  liking  girl   seam   hardly   couldnt care less anyway   make  back  wont   girl   seam youll   girl   victors village  says thats right   win well each   house   part  town reserved  hunger games victors long ago when  games began  capitol had built  dozen fine houses  each district  course  ours only  is occupied most   others  never been lived     disturbing thought hits   then our only neighbor   haymitch ah thatll  nice says peeta tightening  arms around      haymitch very cozy picnics birthdays long winter nights around  fire retelling old hunger games tales  told   hates      cant help laughing   image  haymitch becoming  new pal only sometimes when hes sober ive never heard him   negative thing   says peeta hes never sober  protest thats right  am  thinking  oh  know its cinna  likes   thats mainly because  didnt try  run when  set   fire says peeta   other hand haymitch well   were  id avoid haymitch completely  hates   thought  said  was  favorite    hates  more says peeta  dont think people  general are  sort  thing  know  audience  enjoy our having fun  haymitchs expense  has been around  long hes practically  old friend  some  them  after  headdive off  stage   reaping everybody knows him   time theyll  dragged him    control room  interviews  us no telling  sort  lies hes made  hes  something   disadvantage because most mentors   partner another victor  help them whereas haymitch has   ready   into action  any moment kind  like  when  was alone   arena  wonder how hes holding    drinking  attention   stress  trying  keep us alive its funny haymitch   dont  along well  person  maybe peeta is right  us being alike because  seems able  communicate     timing   gifts like how  knew  must  close  water when  withheld   how  knew  sleep syrup just wasnt something  ease peetas pain  how  know now     play   romance  hasnt made much effort  connect  peeta really perhaps  thinks  bowl  broth  just   bowl  broth  peeta whereas ill see  strings attached    thought hits   im amazed  questions taken  long  surface maybe its because ive only recently begun  view haymitch   degree  curiosity how   think  did   did  peeta asks haymitch how   think  won  games   peeta considers  quite  while before  answers haymitch is sturdily built  no physical wonder like cato  thresh hes  particularly handsome    way  causes sponsors  rain gifts    hes  surly its hard  imagine anyone teaming   him theres only  way haymitch could  won  peeta says  just  im reaching  conclusion myself  outsmarted  others says peeta  nod then let  conversation drop  secretly im wondering  haymitch sobered  long enough  help peeta   because  thought  just might   wits  survive maybe  wasnt always

guarantee its your childrens safety  kids names   right into  reaping balls  everyone elses   swear ill never let  happen  sun eventually rises its light slipping through  cracks  illuminating peetas face    transform into   make  home  perplexing goodnatured boy  can spin  lies  convincingly  whole  panem believes him   hopelessly  love    111 admit   are moments when  makes  believe  myself  least well  friends  think nothing  change  fact  weve saved each others lives  here  beyond    always   boy   bread good friends any thing beyond  though   feel gales gray eyes watching  watching peeta   way  district 12 discomfort causes   move  scoot over  shake peetas shoulder  eyes open sleepily  when  focus    pulls  down   long kiss were wasting hunting time   when  finally break away  wouldnt call  wasting  says giving  big stretch   sits     hunt  empty stomachs  give us  edge  us    stuff ourselves  give us staying power count   peeta says   can see hes surprised when  divide  rest   stew  rice  hand  heaping plate  him   well earn  back today     both plow into our plates even cold its    best things ive ever tasted  abandon  fork  scrape   last dabs  gravy   finger  can feel effie trinket shuddering   manners hey effie watch  says peeta  tosses  fork over  shoulder  literally licks  plate clean   tongue making loud satisfied sounds then  blows  kiss     general  calls  miss  effie  cover  mouth   hand  im laughing stop cato could  right outside our cave  grabs  hand away    care ive got   protect  now says peeta pulling   him come     exasperation extricating myself   grasp   before  gets  another kiss once were packed   standing outside our cave our mood shifts  serious its  though   last few days sheltered   rocks   rain  catos preoccupation  thresh  were given  respite  holiday  sorts now although  day is sunny  warm  both sense were really back   games  hand peeta  knife since whatever weapons  once had are long gone   slips  into  belt  last seven arrows   twelve  sacrificed three   explosion two   feast rattle  bit too loosely   quiver  cant afford  lose any more hell  hunting us  now says peeta cato isnt   wait   prey  wander   hes wounded  begin  wont matter peeta breaks    can move hes coming    rain  stream has overrun its banks  several feet  either side  stop   replenish our water  check  snares  set days ago  come  empty  surprising   weather besides  havent seen many animals  signs  them   area   want food  better head back    old hunting grounds   your call just tell    need    peeta says keep  eye    stay   rocks  much  possible no sense  leaving him tracks  follow  listen  both  us its clear   point   explosion destroyed  hearing   left ear  good id walk   water  cover our tracks completely  im  sure peetas leg could take  current although  drugs  erased  infection hes still pretty weak  forehead hurts along  knife cut  after three days  bleeding has stopped  wear  bandage around  head though just  case physical exertion should bring  back   head  alongside  stream  pass  place where  found peeta camouflaged   weeds  mud  good thing between  downpour   flooded banks  signs   hiding place  been wiped   means   need   can come back  our cave otherwise  wouldnt risk   cato after us  boulders diminish  rocks  eventually turn  pebbles  then   relief were back  pine needles   gentle incline   forest floor   first time  realize    problem navigating  rocky terrain   bad leg well youre naturally going  make some noise  even   smooth bed  needles peeta is loud   meanloudloud   hes stomping  feet  something  turn  look  him   asks youve got  move more quietly   forget  cato youre chasing off every rabbit   tenmile radius really  says sorry  didnt know   start  again  hes  tiny bit better  even  only  working ear hes making  jump can  take your boots off  suggest here  asks  disbelief   id asked him  walk barefoot  hot coals  something    remind myself  hes still  used   woods  its  scary forbidden place beyond  fences  district 12  think  gale   velvet tread its eerie how little sound  makes even when  leaves  fallen  its  challenge  move   without chasing off  game  feel certain hes laughing back home yes   patiently   too  way well both  quieter like  was making any noise   both strip off our boots  socks  while theres some improvement  could swear hes making  effort  snap every branch  encounter needless   although  takes several hours  reach  old camp  rue ive shot nothing   stream  settle down fish might   option   current is still too strong   stop  rest  drink water  try  work   solution ideally id dump peeta now  some simple rootgathering chore   hunt  then hed  left  only  knife  defend himself against catos spears  superior strength   id really like is  try  conceal him somewhere safe then  hunt  come back  collect him     feeling  ego isnt going     suggestion katniss  says  need  split   know im chasing away  game only because your legs hurt   generously because really  can tell thats only  small part   problem  know  says  why dont    show  some plants  gather   way well both  useful   cato comes  kills   tried      nice way   still sounds like  think hes  weakling surprisingly  just laughs look  can handle cato  fought him before didnt  yeah   turned  great  ended  dying   mud bank thats   want     cant  did save  life  taking  cato after   try another tactic    climbed    tree  acted   lookout while  hunted   trying  make  sound like very important work    show  whats edible around here    us some meat  says mimicking  tone just dont  far  case  need help  sigh  show him some roots  dig   need food no question  apple two rolls   blob  cheese  size   plum wont last long ill just   short distance  hope cato is  long way off  teach him  bird whistle   melody like rues   simple twonote whistle   can use  communicate  were  right fortunately hes good   leaving him   pack  head off  feel like im eleven again tethered    safety   fence   peeta allowing myself twenty maybe thirty yards  hunting space away  him though  woods come alive  animal sounds reassured   periodic whistles  allow myself  drift farther away  soon  two rabbits   fat squirrel  show    decide its enough  can set snares  maybe  some fish  peetas roots    enough  now   travel  short distance back  realize  havent exchanged signals   while when  whistle receives no response  run  no time  find  pack  neat pile  roots beside   sheet  plastic has been laid   ground where  sun can reach  single layer  berries  covers   where is  peeta  call    panic peeta  turn   rustle  brush  almost send  arrow through him fortunately  pull  bow   last second   sticks   oak trunk   left  jumps back flinging  handful  berries into  foliage  fear comes   anger  are  doing youre supposed   here  running around   woods  found some berries down   stream  says clearly confused   outburst  whistled why didnt  whistle backisnap  him  didnt hear  waters too loud  guess  says  crosses  puts  hands   shoulders thats when  feel  im trembling  thought cato killed   almost shout no im fine peeta wraps  arms around    dont respond katniss  push away trying  sort   feelings  two people agree   signal  stay  range because    them doesnt answer theyre  trouble  right  right  says  right because thats  happened  rue   watched  die    turn away  him    pack  open  fresh bottle  water although  still  some  mine  im  ready  forgive him  notice  food  rolls  apples are untouched  someones definitely picked away part   cheese   ate without   really dont care  just want something else   mad   no  didnt peeta says oh   suppose  apples ate  cheese    dont know  ate  cheese peeta says slowly  distinctly   trying   lose  temper   wasnt  ive been down   stream collecting berries   care  some   actually   dont want  relent too soon   walk over  look  them ive never seen  type before no       arena these arent rues berries although  resemble them nor   match any  learned   training  lean down  scoop   few rolling them between  fingers  fathers voice comes back    these katniss never these theyre nightlock  11  dead before  reach your stomach just then  cannon fires  whip around expecting peeta  collapse   ground   only raises  eyebrows  hovercraft appears  hundred yards   away whats left  foxfaces emaciated body is lifted into  air  can see  red glint   hair   sunlight  should  known  moment  saw  missing cheese peeta has    arm pushing  toward  tree climb hell  here   second well stand  better chance fighting him  above  stop him suddenly calm no peeta shes your kill  catos   havent even seen  since  first day  says how could   killed   answer  hold   berries  takes  while  explain  situation  peeta how foxface stole  food   supply pile before  blew   how  tried  take enough  stay alive   enough  anyone  notice  how  wouldnt question  safely  berries  were preparing  eat ourselves  wonder how  found us says peeta  fault  guess  im  loud     were   hard  follow   herd  cattle   try   kind  shes very clever peeta well  was until  outfoxed    purpose doesnt seem fair somehow  mean    both been dead too   hadnt eaten  berries first  checks himself no  course  wouldnt  recognized them didnt   give  nod  call them nightlock even  name sounds deadly  says im sorry katniss  really thought  were  same ones youd gathered dont apologize  just means were  step closer  home right  ask ill  rid   rest peeta says  gathers   sheet  blue plastic careful  trap  berries inside  goes  toss them into  woods wait  cry  find  leather pouch  belonged   boy  district 1  fill    few handfuls  berries   plastic   fooled foxface maybe  can fool cato  well  hes chasing us  something  can act like  accidentally drop  pouch    eats them then hello district twelve says peeta thats    securing  pouch   belt hell know where  are now says peeta   was anywhere nearby  saw  hovercraft hell know  killed   come after us peetas right  could  just  opportunity catos been waiting   even   run now theres  meat  cook  our fire   another sign  our whereabouts lets make  fire right now  begin  gather branches  brush are  ready  face him peeta asks im ready  eat better  cook our food while    chance   knows were here  knows   also knows theres two  us  probably assumes  were hunting foxface  means youre recovered   fire means were  hiding were inviting him here   show   ask maybe   says peetas  whiz  fires coaxing  blaze    damp wood  no time    rabbits  squirrel roasting  roots wrapped  leaves baking   coals  take turns gathering greens  keeping  careful watch  cato    anticipated  doesnt make  appearance when  foods cooked  pack most    leaving us each  rabbits leg  eat   walk  want  move higher into  woods climb  good tree  make camp   night  peeta resists  cant climb like  katniss especially   leg   dont think  could ever fall asleep fifty feet above  ground its  safe  stay   open peeta   cant   back   cave  asks its near water  easy  defend  sigh several more hours  walking  should   crashing through  woods  reach  area well just   leave   morning  hunt  peeta doesnt ask  much hes followed  instructions  day  im sure  things were reversed  wouldnt make  spend  night   tree  dawns     havent been very nice  peeta today nagging him  how loud  was screaming  him over disappearing  playful romance  had sustained   cave has disappeared    open under  hot sun   threat  cato looming over us haymitch has probably just  had        audience  reach   give him  kiss sure lets  back   cave  looks pleased  relieved well  was easy  work  arrow    oak careful   damage  shaft these arrows are food safety  life itself now  toss  bunch more wood   fire  should  sending off smoke   few more hours although  doubt cato assumes anything   point when  reach  stream  see  water has dropped considerably  moves  its old leisurely pace   suggest  walk back   peetas happy  oblige  since hes  lot quieter  water than  land its  doubly good idea its  long walk back   cave though even going downward even   rabbit  give us  boost were both exhausted  our hike today  still way too underfed  keep  bow loaded both  cato  any fish  might see   stream seems strangely empty  creatures   time  reach our destination our feet are dragging   sun sits low   horizon  fill  our water bottles  climb  little slope  our den its  much   here   wilderness its  closest thing     home    warmer than  tree too because  provides some shelter   wind  has begun  blow steadily    west  set  good dinner   halfway through peeta begins  nod off after days  inactivity  hunt has taken its toll  order him into  sleeping bag  set aside  rest   food  when  wakes  drops off immediately  pull  sleeping bag    chin  kiss  forehead    audience    because im  grateful  hes still here  dead   stream  id thought  glad   dont   face cato alone brutal bloody cato  can snap  neck   twist   arm  had  power  overcome thresh  has had     since  beginning  probably has had  special hatred   ever since  outscored him  training  boy like peeta  simply shrug  off     feeling  drove cato  distraction  is   hard  think   ridiculous reaction  finding  supplies blown   others were upset  course   was completely unhinged  wonder now  cato might   entirely sane  sky lights    seal   watch foxface shine   sky  then disappear   world forever  hasnt said    dont think peeta felt good  killing  even   was essential  cant pretend ill miss      admire   guess is   had given us some sort  test    been  smartest    tributes   fact  had been setting  trap    bet shed  sensed   avoided  berries  was peetas own ignorance  brought  down ive spent  much time making sure  dont underestimate  opponents  ive forgotten its just  dangerous  overestimate them  well  brings  back  cato  while  think  had  sense  foxface   was  how  operated hes  little more slippery powerful well trained  smart  dont know  like  was  utterly lacking   control foxface demonstrated  believe cato could easily lose  judgment   fit  temper    can feel superior   point  think   moment  sent  arrow flying into  apple   pigs mouth when  was  enraged maybe   understand cato better than  think despite  fatigue   body  minds alert   let peeta sleep long past our usual switch  fact  soft gray day has begun when  shake  shoulder  looks  almost  alarm  slept  whole night thats  fair katniss  should  woken   stretch  burrow down into  bag ill sleep now wake   anything interesting happens apparently nothing does because when  open  eyes bright hot afternoon light gleams through  rocks any sign  our friend  ask peeta shakes  head no hes keeping  disturbingly low profile how long   think well  before  gamemakers drive us together  ask well foxface died almost  day ago  theres been plenty  time   audience  place bets   bored  guess  could happen  any moment says peeta yeah    feeling todays  day    sit   look    peaceful terrain  wonder how theyll   peeta remains silent theres  really any good answer well until   no sense  wasting  hunting day   should probably eat  much   can hold just  case  run into trouble   peeta packs  our gear while  lay   big meal  rest   rabbits roots greens  rolls spread   last bit  cheese  only thing  leave  reserve is  squirrel   apple   time were done  thats left is  pile  rabbit bones  hands are greasy  only adds   growing feeling  grubbiness maybe  dont bathe daily   seam   keep cleaner than    late except   feet   walked   stream im covered   layer  grime leaving  cave has  sense  finality    dont think    another night   arena somehow  way   other dead  alive    feeling 111 escape  today  give  rocks  pat goodbye   head down   stream  wash   can feel  skin itching   cool water  may   hair  braid  back wet im wondering   might even  able  give our clothes  quick scrub when  reach  stream   used    stream now theres only  bonedry bed  put  hand down  feel   even  little damp  must  drained  while  slept    fear   cracked tongue aching body  fuzzy mind brought    previous dehydration creeps into  consciousness our bottles  skin are fairly full   two drinking   hot sun  wont take long  deplete them  lake says peeta thats where  want us   maybe  ponds still  some   hopefully  can check  says  hes just humoring  im humoring myself because  know  ill find when  return   pond where  soaked  leg  dusty gaping mouth   hole   make  trip anyway just  confirm   already know youre right theyre driving us   lake   where theres no cover where theyre guaranteed  bloody fight   death  nothing  block  view   want   straightaway  wait until  waters tapped  lets  now while weve had food  rest lets just  end  thing  says  nod its funny  feel almost   its  first day   games again  im   same position twentyone tributes are dead   still  yet  kill cato  really wasnt  always    kill now  seems  other tributes were just minor obstacles distractions keeping us   real battle   games cato    no theres  boy waiting beside   feel  arms wrap around  two against  should   piece  cake  says next time  eat      capitol  answer  bet    says  stand   while locked   embrace feeling each other  sunlight  rustle   leaves  our feet then without  word  break apart  head   lake  dont care now  peetas footfalls send rodents scurrying make birds take wing    fight cato  id just  soon   here    plain   doubt ill   choice   gamemakers want us   open then   open     stop  rest   few moments under  tree where  careers trapped   husk   tracker jacker nest beaten   pulp   heavy rains  dried   burning sun confirms  location  touch    tip   boot   dissolves into dust  is quickly carried off   breeze  cant help looking    tree where rue secretly perched waiting  save  life tracker j ackers glimmers bloated body  terrifying hallucinations lets move    wanting  escape  darkness  surrounds  place peeta doesnt object given our late start   day when  reach  plain its already early evening theres no sign  cato no sign  anything except  gold cornucopia glowing   slanting sun rays just  case cato decided  pull  foxface  us  circle  cornucopia  make sure its empty then obediently   following instructions  cross   lake  fill our water containers  frown   shrinking sun  dont want  fight him after dark theres only   pair  glasses peeta carefully squeezes drops  iodine into  water maybe thats  hes waiting     want    back   cave either   find  tree  lets give him another half  hour   then well take cover  answer  sit   lake  full sight theres no point  hiding now   trees   edge   plain  can see  mockingjays flitting  bouncing melodies back  forth between them like brightly colored balls  open  mouth  sing  rues fournote run  can feel them pause curiously   sound   voice listening  more  repeat  notes   silence first  mockingjay trills  tune back then another then  whole world comes alive   sound just like your father says peeta  fingers find  pin   shirt thats rues song    think  remember   music swells   recognize  brilliance     notes overlap  compliment  another forming  lovely unearthly harmony  was  sound then thanks  rue  sent  orchard workers  district 1 1 home each night does someone start   quitting time  wonder now   is dead   while  just close  eyes  listen mesmerized   beauty   song then something begins  disrupt  music runs cut off  jagged imperfect lines dissonant notes intersperse   melody  mockingjays voices rise    shrieking cry  alarm were  our feet peeta wielding  knife  poised  shoot when cato smashes through  trees  bears down  us  has no spear  fact  hands are empty yet  runs straight  us  first arrow hits  chest  inexplicably falls aside hes got some kind  body armor  shout  peeta just  time too because cato is upon us  brace myself   rockets right between us  no attempt  check  speed  can tell   panting  sweat pouring off  purplish face  hes been running hard  long time  toward us  something    eyes scan  woods just  time  see  first creature leap onto  plain  im turning away  see another half dozen join  then  am stumbling blindly after cato  no thought  anything   save myself muttations no question   ive never seen these mutts  theyre no naturalborn animals  resemble huge wolves   wolf lands  then balances easily  its hind legs  wolf waves  rest   pack forward  its front paw  though  had  wrist these things  can see   distance  close im sure  more menacing attributes   revealed cato has made  beeline   cornucopia  without question  follow him   thinks its  safest place  am   argue besides even   could make    trees    impossible  peeta  outrun them   leg peeta  hands  just landed   metal   pointed tail   cornucopia when  remember im part   team hes  fifteen yards behind  hobbling  fast   can   mutts are closing

cato just laughs shoot    goes down   hes right   take him    falls   mutts peeta is sure  die  him weve reached  stalemate  cant shoot cato without killing peeta too  cant kill peeta without guaranteeing  arrow   brain  stand like statues both  us seeking    muscles are strained  tightly  feel  might snap  any moment  teeth clenched   breaking point  mutts  silent   only thing  can hear is  blood pounding   good ear peetas lips are turning blue   dont  something quickly hell die  asphyxiation  then 111  lost him  cato  probably use  body   weapon against   fact im sure  is catos plan because while hes stopped laughing  lips are set   triumphant smile     lastditch effort peeta raises  fingers dripping  blood   leg   catos arm instead  trying  wrestle  way free  forefinger veers off  makes  deliberate x   back  catos hand cato realizes   means exactly  second after    can tell   way  smile drops   lips  its  second too late because   time  arrow is piercing  hand  cries   reflexively releases peeta  slams back against him   horrible moment  think theyre both going over  dive forward just catching hold  peeta  cato loses  footing   bloodslick horn  plummets   ground

remarkable strength  skill  is simply overpowered  dont know how long  has been maybe  hour   when cato hits  ground   hear  mutts dragging him dragging him back into  cornucopia now theyll finish him off  think  theres still no cannon night falls   anthem plays  theres no picture  cato   sky only  faint moans coming through  metal beneath us  icy air blowing across  plain reminds    games are

startled still half   arena  guess easy just  lets   look   haymitch says  hold   arms  turn once good enough its  much   compliment     haymitchs eyes shift around  musty holding space   seems  make  decision  nothing how   hug  luck okay thats  odd request  haymitch  after   are victors maybe  hug  luck is  order only when  put  arms around  neck  find myself trapped   embrace  begins talking very fast very quietly   ear  hair concealing  lips listen  youre  trouble word is  capitols furious   showing them    arena   thing  cant stand is being laughed   theyre  joke  panemsays haymitch  feel dread coursing through  now   laugh  though haymitch is saying something completely delightful because nothing is covering  mouth   your only defense can   were  madly  love  werent responsible  your actions haymitch pulls back  adjusts  hairband got  sweetheart  could  talking  anything now got    did  tell peeta  dont   says haymitch hes already    think im    taking  opportunity  straighten  bright red bow tie cinna must  wrestled him into since when does  matter   think says haymitch better take our places  leads    metal circle  is your night sweetheart enjoy   kisses    forehead  disappears into  gloom  tug   skirt willing    longer wanting   cover  knocking   knees then  realize its pointless  whole bodys shaking like  leaf hopefully    put down  excitement after

arena when  trumpets played  was supposed   safe  then    rest   life    haymitch says is true  hes got no reason  lie ive never been  such  dangerous place   life its  much worse than being hunted   arena   could only die end  story   here prim  mother gale  people  district 12 everyone  care  back home could  punished   cant pull off  girldrivencrazybylove scenario haymitch has suggested   still   chance though funny   arena when  poured  those berries  was only thinking  outsmarting  gamemakers  how  actions  reflect   capitol   hunger games are  weapon   are  supposed   able  defeat   now  capitol  act   theyve been  control  whole time    orchestrated  whole event right down   double suicide    only work   play along  them  peeta peeta  suffer too   goes wrong   was  haymitch said when  asked   had told peeta  situation   had  pretend   desperately  love dont   hes already  already thinking ahead     games again  well aware   danger were   already desperately  love  dont know  havent even begun  separate   feelings  peeta its too complicated   did  part   games  opposed    did   anger   capitol  because  how    viewed back  district 12  simply because  was  only decent thing      did because  cared  him these are questions   unraveled back home   peace  quiet   woods when no  is watching  here  every eye upon    wont   luxury   knows how long  right now  most dangerous part   hunger games is   begin  anthem booms   ears  then  hear caesar flickerman greeting  audience does  know how crucial  is   every word right  now   must   want  help us  crowd breaks into applause   prep teams are presented  imagine flavius venia  octavia bouncing around  taking ridiculous bobbing bows its  safe bet theyre clueless then effies introduced how long shes waited   moment  hope shes able  enjoy  because  misguided  effie can   has  very keen instinct  certain things  must  least suspect were  trouble portia  cinna receive huge cheers  course theyve been brilliant had  dazzling debut  now understand cinna s choice  dress    tonight ill need  look  girlish  innocent  possible haymitchs appearance brings  round  stomping  goes   least five minutes well hes accomplished  first keeping  only   two tributes alive    hadnt warned   time    acted differently flaunted  moment   berries   capitols face no  dont think    could easily  been  lot less convincing than  need   now right now because  can feel  plate lifting     stage blinding lights  deafening roar rattles  metal under  feet then theres peeta just  few yards away  looks  clean  healthy  beautiful  can hardly recognize him   smile is  same whether  mud    capitol  when  see   take  three steps  fling myself into  arms  staggers back almost losing  balance  thats when  realize  slim metal contraption   hand is some kind  cane  rights himself   just cling  each other while  audience goes insane hes kissing     time im thinking   know   know how much danger were  after  ten minutes   caesar flickerman taps   shoulder  continue  show  peeta just pushes him aside without even glancing  him  audience goes berserk whether  knows   peeta is  usual playing  crowd exactly right finally haymitch interrupts us  gives us  good natured shove toward  victors chair usually  is  single ornate chair    winning tribute watches  film   highlights   games  since  are two  us  gamemakers  provided  plush red velvet couch  small   mother  call   love seat  think  sit  close  peeta  im practically   lap   look  haymitch tells   isnt enough kicking off  sandals  tuck  feet   side  lean  head against peetas shoulder  arm goes around  automatically   feel like im back   cave curled  against him trying  keep warm  shirt is made   same yellow material   dress  portias put him  long black pants no sandals either   pair  sturdy black boots  keeps solidly planted   stage  wish cinna had given   similar outfit  feel  vulnerable   flimsy dress   guess  was  point caesar flickerman makes  few more jokes  then its time   show   last exactly three hours  is required viewing    panem   lights dim   seal appears   screen  realize im unprepared      want  watch  twenty two fellow tributes die  saw enough  them die  first time  heart starts pounding     strong impulse  run how   other victors faced  alone during  highlights  periodically show  winners reaction    box   corner   screen  think back  earlier years some are triumphant pumping  fists   air beating  chests most just seem stunned   know is   only thing keeping    love seat is peeta  arm around  shoulder  other hand claimed  both  mine  course  previous victors didnt   capitol looking   way  destroy them condensing several weeks into three hours is quite  feat especially when  consider how many cameras were going  once whoever puts together  highlights has  choose  sort  story  tell  year   first time  tell  love story  know peeta   won   disproportionate amount  time is spent  us right   beginning im glad though because  supports  whole crazyin love thing thats  defense  defying  capitol plus  means  wont   much time  linger over  deaths  first half hour   focuses   prearena events  reaping

smiling   picture is taken   thing  never  is let   peetas hand  sun is just peeking over  horizon when  straggle back   twelfth floor   training center  think now 111 finally   word alone  peeta  haymitch sends him off  portia   something fitted   interview  personally escorts    door why cant  talk  him  ask plenty  time  talk when   home says haymitch   bed youre  air  two despite haymitchs running interference im determined  see peeta privately after  toss  turn   few hours  slip into  hall  first thought is  check  roof  its empty even  city streets far below are deserted after  celebration last night   back  bed   while  then decide   directly   room  when  try  turn  knob  find  own bedroom door has been locked   outside  suspect haymitch initially  then theres  more insidious fear   capitol may  monitoring  confining  ive been unable  escape since  hunger games began   feels different much more personal  feels like ive been imprisoned   crime  im awaiting sentencing  quickly  back  bed  pretend  sleep until effie trinket comes  alert    start  another big big big day    five minutes  eat  bowl  hot grain  stew before  prep team descends      is  crowd loved   its unnecessary  speak   next couple  hours when cinna comes   shoos them   dresses    white gauzy dress  pink shoes then  personally adjusts  makeup until  seem  radiate  soft rosy glow  make idle chitchat  im afraid  ask him anything  real importance because after  incident   door  cant shake  feeling  im being watched constantly  interview takes place right down  hall   sitting room  space has been cleared   love seat has been moved   surrounded  vases  red  pink roses  are only  handful  cameras  record  event no live audience  least caesar flickerman gives   warm hug when  come  congratulations katniss how are  faring fine nervous   interview   dont  were going    fabulous time  says giving  cheek  reassuring pat im  good  talking  myself   nothing     wrong  says   think oh

us apart haymitch is actually bent  keeping us alive   are too many ears listening   just  yes hes gotten very responsible lately well theres just     home then  cant watch us   time says peeta  feel  sort  shiver run through   theres no time  analyze why because theyre ready  us  sit somewhat formally   love seat  caesar says oh  ahead  curl  next  him   want  looked very sweet   tuck  feet   peeta pulls   close  him someone counts backward  just like  were being broadcast live   entire country caesar flickerman is wonderful teasing joking getting choked  when  occasion presents itself   peeta already   rapport  established  night   first interview  easy banter   just smile  lot  try  speak  little  possible  mean    talk some   soon   can  redirect  conversation back  peeta eventually though caesar begins  pose questions  insist  fuller answers well peeta  know  our days   cave   was love  first sight     age five caesar says   moment  laid eyes   says peeta  katniss   ride    think  real excitement   audience was watching  fall  him when did  realize  were  love  him asks caesar oh thats  hard   give  faint breathy laugh  look down   hands help well  know when  hit   night when  shouted   name   tree says caesar thank  caesar  think  then    idea yes  guess  was   mean until  point  just tried   think    feelings might  honestly because  was  confusing   only made things worse   actually cared  him  then   tree everything changed   why   think  was urges caesar maybe because   first time  was  chance  could keep him   behind  cameraman  see haymitch give  sort  huff  relief   know ive said  right thing caesar pulls   handkerchief  has  take  moment because hes  moved  can feel peeta press  forehead into  temple   asks  now  youve got   are  going      turn   him put  somewhere  cant  hurt  when  kisses  people   room actually sigh  caesar  is  natural place  segue into   ways  did  hurt   arena  burns  stings  wounds  its  until   around   mutts

death  sure without   guess  is true   cant help feeling upset     extent  im afraid  might cry  then  remember everyone   country is watching    just bury  face  peetas shirt  takes them  couple  minutes  coax  back  because its better   shirt where no  can see   when   come  caesar backs off questioning    can recover  fact  pretty much leaves  alone until  berries come  katniss  know youve had  shock  ive got  ask  moment when  pulled  those berries  was going   your mind hm  says  take  long pause before  answer trying  collect  thoughts  is  crucial moment where  either challenged  capitol  went  crazy   idea  losing peeta   cant  held responsible   actions  seems  call   big dramatic speech      is  almost inaudible sentence  dont know  just couldnt bear  thought  being without him peeta anything  add asks caesar no  think  goes  both  us  says caesar signs off  its over everyones laughing  crying  hugging  im still  sure until  reach haymitchokay  whisper perfect  answers
